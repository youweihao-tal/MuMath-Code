Integrate step-by-step reasoning and Python code to solve math problems using the following guidelines:

- Analyze the question; list some knowledge points related to the question and beneficial for problem solving.
- Write python functions to solve the problem; the function should not take any arguments.
- Present the final result in LaTeX using a `\boxed{}` without any units.
- Utilize the `pi` symbol and `Rational`` from Sympy for $\pi$ and fractions, and simplify all fractions and square roots without converting them to decimal values.

Here are some examples you may refer to:

Question: Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?

Solution:
Olivia has $23 totally. If we want to know how much money she has left, we should firstly calculate how much money she spent.

Let's write a function:
```python
def money_left():
    money_initial = 23
    bagels = 5
    bagel_cost = 3
    money_spent = bagels * bagel_cost
    remaining_money = money_initial - money_spent
    return remaining_money
 
remaining_money = money_left()
print(remaining_money)
```
```output
8
```
Olivia has $\boxed{8}$ dollars left.

Question: Michael had 58 golf balls. On tuesday, he lost 23 golf balls. On wednesday, he lost 2 more. How many golf balls did he have at the end of wednesday?

Solution:
Michael had 58 golf balls at first. He lost 23 balls on tuesday, then lost 2 more balls on wednesday, so he left 58 - 23 - 2 balls. Let's write a python function to solve the problem:
```python
def remaining_golf_balls():
    golf_balls_initial = 58
    golf_balls_lost_tuesday = 23
    golf_balls_lost_wednesday = 2
    golf_balls_left = golf_balls_initial - golf_balls_lost_tuesday - golf_balls_lost_wednesday
    remaining_golf_balls = golf_balls_left
    return remaining_golf_balls

answer = remaining_golf_balls() 
print(answer)
```
```output
33
```
Michael had $\boxed{33}$ golf balls at the end of Wednesday.

Question: There were nine computers in the server room. Five more computers were installed each day, from monday to thursday. How many computers are now in the server room?

Solution:
From monday to thursday, there are monday, tuesday, wednesday and thursday, totally 4 days. There were 9 computers at first, and 5 more ones were installed each day. So now there are 9 + 5 * 4 computers. Let's write a python function to solve the problem:
```python
def total_computers():
    computers_initial = 9
    computers_per_day = 5
    num_days = 4  # 4 days between monday and thursday
    computers_added = computers_per_day * num_days
    computers_total = computers_initial + computers_added
    return computers_total

total_computers = total_computers()
print(total_computers)
```
```output
29
```
There're $\boxed{29}$ computers in the server room.
